# AutoTextEdit
This is an automatic text editor that can automate a lot of the edits that you may have to do
You can configure it by going into the edit.json file
All strings in the remove list are removed from the text file, while all lists in the edit list will have the 1st item in the list replaced with the 2nd inside of the text
This can help you to automate a lot of thigns that would've otherwise had to have been done by hand, and can thus help to remove things like 0 width spaces
As you can see there is already an example in the files, for which you can clear the text files and for the json, everything in the lists
